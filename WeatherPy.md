WeatherPy - Three observable trends based on the data 

1. According to the City Latitude vs Max Temperature analysis, it is clear that cities nearer the equator (latitude 0) are much warmer than cities nearer to the poles.

2. By looking at the City Latitude vs Humidity, there is no strong evidence to suggest any variance of humididity based on latitude. In other words, humidity appears to be consistent across latitudes. However, nearer to the north pole and equator latitudes there is an absence of lower humidity values.

3. By looking at the City Latitude vs Cloudiness, eventhough we apreciate a moderate increment in cloudiness after latitude 40, cloudiness does not seem to vary significantly over latitudes.

4. The City Latitude vs Wind Speed suggests an insidence of wind speed high values nearer to the poles latitude when low values are more concentrated near the equator.
